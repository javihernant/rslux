# Lux Interpreter

## Description
By following the excellent book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com) by Robert Nystrom I am creating an interpreter of a new programming language, Lux.
The code contained in the book is written in Java. And, because I am learning Rust, I thought it would be fun to port it.

## Usage
There are two working modes:
- File mode. You'll have to provide the path to the source file as an argument
- Interactive mode. No args are passed. In this mode you write the code directly to the terminal. Line by line.

## Credits
- [Robert Nystrom](https://craftinginterpreters.com) for providing such great material for free
- The rust-lang community.
